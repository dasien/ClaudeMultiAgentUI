## What's New in v5.0

### Major Architecture Change

**v4.x Philosophy**: Agents defined their own workflow behavior
- Agents specified inputs, outputs, and next agents
- Workflow orchestration hardcoded in agent definitions
- Same agent couldn't work differently in different workflows

**v5.0 Philosophy**: Agents are reusable components, workflows orchestrate them
- Agents define only their capabilities (tools and skills)
- Workflow templates define inputs, outputs, and chaining
- Same agent can work in multiple workflows with different configurations

### New Features

#### 1. **Simplified Agent Management**
- **Removed**: Workflow configuration from agent creation
- **Focus**: Just capabilities - tools and skills
- **Benefit**: Agents are truly reusable across workflows

#### 2. **Visual Workflow Template Editor**
- **Configure**: Input patterns, output filenames, status transitions
- **Manage**: Transitions with visual UI (add/edit/remove)
- **Validate**: Workflows before saving with clear feedback
- **Benefit**: No more manual JSON editing

#### 3. **Workflow Starter Dialog**
- **Quick Launch**: Start workflows with one click
- **Pre-flight Checks**: Validates before starting
- **Integration**: Works with enhancement generator
- **Benefit**: Much faster than command line

#### 4. **Dynamic Workflow Loading**
- **Auto-discovery**: All workflow templates appear in dropdowns
- **Custom Workflows**: Create your own, they work everywhere
- **Benefit**: No hardcoded workflows, full flexibility

#### 5. **Workflow Context in Tasks**
- **Display**: Shows workflow name, step position, expected outputs
- **Understanding**: Clear expectations for each task
- **Benefit**: Better visibility into workflow progress

## Main Window Overview

<img src="assets/docs_img_task_list.png" width="80%" alt="Main Task List">

### Header Bar

The header displays your connection status:

```
Connected: /path/to/your/project     CMAT v5.0
```

- **Left side**: Shows project root path when connected
- **Right side**: Shows CMAT version number

### Task Queue Table

The main table displays all tasks with columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Task ID** | Unique identifier (e.g., `task_2025-01-15_1234567890`) |
| **Workflow** | Workflow name from metadata (if part of workflow) |
| **Title** | Short task description |
| **Enhancement** | Enhancement title from metadata |
| **Agent** | Assigned agent name |
| **Status** | Current status (Pending, Active, Completed, Failed) |

### Task Status Colors

Tasks are color-coded for quick identification:

- **White background** - Pending tasks
- **Light yellow background** - Active tasks
- **Light green background** - Completed tasks
- **Light red background** - Failed tasks

### Task Sorting

Tasks are automatically sorted by:
1. **Status** (pending → active → completed → failed)
2. **Task ID descending** within each status group

This means the most recent tasks in each status group appear at the top, making it easy to see the latest activity.

### Status Bar

The bottom status bar shows:

- **Left**: Connection status and task counts
  - Example: `5 Pending | 2 Active | 23 Completed | 1 Failed`
- **Right**: Auto-refresh status
  - Example: `Auto-refresh: ✓ ON (3s)` or `Auto-refresh: OFF`

**Steps**:

1. Click **Browse...** or enter a directory path
   - This is where the `.claude/` folder will be created
   - Example: `/home/user/my-new-project/`

2. **Directory Validation**: The dialog checks:
   - ✓ Directory exists and is writable
   - ⚠ Warning if `.claude/` already exists (offers overwrite)
   - ✗ Error if path is invalid or not writable

3. Click **Install**
   - Progress bar shows download and extraction
   - Takes 10-30 seconds depending on connection

4. **On Success**:
   - Shows success dialog with installation location
   - Option to "Connect Now" or "Close"

5. **If Overwriting**:
   - Automatic backup created: `.claude_backup_[random]/`
   - Backup deleted on successful installation
   - Backup restored on failure

**What gets installed**:
- `.claude/scripts/cmat.sh` - Main CMAT command
- `.claude/agents/agents.json` - Agent definitions

- `.claude/queues/workflow_templates.json` - Workflow templates
- And more...

### Connecting to Existing Project

**When to use**: You already have a CMAT project and want to work with it.

**Menu**: File > Connect...  
**Shortcut**: `Ctrl+O`

**Steps**:

1. Click **Browse...**
2. Navigate to your **project root directory**
   - This is the directory that CONTAINS `.claude/`
   - NOT the `.claude/` directory itself

3. **Validation Checks**: The dialog validates:
   - ✓ CMAT script (`.claude/scripts/cmat.sh`)
   - ✓ Task queue (`.claude/queues/task_queue.json`)
   - ✓ Workflow templates (`.claude/queues/workflow_templates.json`)
   - ✓ Skills system (`.claude/skills/skills.json`)
   - ✓ Agents (`.claude/agents/agents.json`)

4. **Version Detection**:
   - Shows "✓ Valid CMAT v5.0 Project" if all checks pass
   - Shows warning if v4.x detected (still works, but limited features)

5. Click **Connect**

**After Connecting**:

## Task Management

### Understanding Tasks

A **task** represents work assigned to an agent. Each task:

- Has a unique ID
- References a source file (usually a markdown enhancement)
- Contains instructions for the agent
- Produces outputs according to workflow step configuration
- Can chain to the next agent in the workflow 
- May be part of a workflow (has workflow metadata)

### Creating a Task

## Agent Management

### Understanding Agents

**Agents** are now simplified capability definitions. Each agent specifies:
- **Role** - What category of work (analysis, implementation, testing, etc.)
- **Tools** - Which Claude Code tools they can use
- **Skills** - Specialized capabilities assigned to them
- **Instructions** - How they should approach their work

**What Agents NO LONGER Specify** (moved to workflow templates):
- ❌ Input patterns
- ❌ Output directories
- ❌ Success status codes
- ❌ Next agent mappings

This makes agents reusable - the same architect agent can work differently in a feature workflow vs. a refactoring workflow.

### Viewing Agents

**Menu**: Agents > Manage Agents...

The Agent Manager shows all agents in a table:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Workflow Template Management

### What are Workflow Templates?

**Workflow templates** define how agents work together to process enhancements. Templates specify:

**For each step**:
- Which agent executes
- **Input pattern** - Where the step reads its input from
- **Required output** - What filename the step must create
- **Status transitions** - What happens when agent outputs each status code

**Example Workflow Template**:
```
Workflow: New Feature Development
  Step 1: Requirements Analyst
    Input: enhancements/{enhancement_name}/{enhancement_name}.md
    Output: analysis_summary.md
    Transitions:
      READY_FOR_DEVELOPMENT → Step 2 (auto-chain)
  
  Step 2: Architect
    Input: {previous_step}/required_output/
    Output: implementation_plan.md
    Transitions:
      READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION → Step 3 (auto-chain)
  
  ... and so on
```

## Workflow Visualization

### Understanding Workflows

A **workflow** is the sequence of agents that process an enhancement. Workflows are defined by templates and can be any length.

### Viewing Active Workflows

**Menu**: Workflows > View Active Workflows...  
**Shortcut**: `Ctrl+W`

Shows visual progress for each enhancement being worked on.

#### What's New in v5.0?

**Dynamic Step Display**:
- Loads actual workflow template from task metadata
- Shows real number of steps (not hardcoded 5)
- Works with 2-step workflows, 8-step workflows, any length
- Falls back to legacy view for tasks without workflow metadata

**Workflow Display** 

For each active workflow:

1. **Enhancement Title** - Shows enhancement name and workflow name
2. **Progress Bar** - Based on actual step count
3. **Agent Steps** - Shows all steps from template:
   - ✓ Green - Completed
   - → Orange - Currently active
   - ○ Blue - Pending
   - ✗ Red - Failed
4. **Step Details** - Shows expected output for steps
5. **Current Status** - Overall workflow state
6. **Next Step** - Which agent executes next (if applicable)

**Example Display**:
```
Enhancement: user-authentication | Workflow: New Feature Development

35% complete (2/5 steps)
████████░░░░░░░░░░░░

✓ Step 1: Requirements Analyst (completed, 2m 45s)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

#### "Not a valid CMAT project"

**Cause**: Directory structure doesn't match CMAT v5.0.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify selecting **project root**, not `.claude/` directory
2. Check `.claude/scripts/cmat.sh` exists
3. Check `.claude/queues/workflow_templates.json` exists

#### "CMAT script not found"

**Cause**: Invalid path to `cmat.sh`.

**Solutions**:
1. Use File > Connect... to browse
2. Verify execute permissions: `chmod +x .claude/scripts/cmat.sh`

### Workflow Issues 

#### "Workflow not in dropdown"

**Cause**: Workflow template not found.

**Solutions**:
1. Workflows > Manage Templates
2. Verify template exists
3. If missing, create new template
4. Refresh task creation dialog

#### "Cannot start workflow - validation failed"

**Cause**: Workflow has validation errors.

**Solutions**:
1. Edit workflow template
2. Click **Validate Workflow**
3. Fix reported issues:
   - Missing input/output configurations
   - Invalid transition targets
   - Missing required fields
4. Save template

#### "Step not auto-chaining"

**Cause**: Status transition not configured or wrong status code.

**Solutions**:
1. Check agent's output status in task log
2. Edit workflow template
3. Edit the step that should chain
4. Click **Manage Transitions...**
5. Add transition for the actual status code
6. Set auto-chain: ✓
7. Save changes

#### "Workflow starter shows 'Enhancement spec not found'"

**Cause**: File doesn't exist at specified path.

**Solutions**:
1. Click **Browse Existing...** and verify file path
2. Or click **Create New...** to generate spec
3. Ensure file was actually saved (check in file manager)

### Agent Issues

#### "Cannot find workflow tab in agent creation"

- Workflow orchestration moved to workflow templates
- Agents now only define capabilities
- Configure workflows separately in Workflow Template Manager

#### "Agent has no input/output configuration"

- Input/output now configured in workflow templates
- Each workflow can use agent with different inputs/outputs
- Agent just defines what tools and skills it has

### Task Issues

#### "Task not showing workflow context"

**Cause**: Task not started via workflow system.

**This is normal**:
- Only tasks started with `cmat workflow start` have workflow metadata
- Manually created tasks don't have workflow context
- Both types of tasks work fine

#### "Expected status not in dropdown"

**For workflow tasks**:
- Expected statuses shown in task details
- Use one of the listed statuses for auto-chain
- Other statuses will stop the workflow (manual intervention needed)

**For standalone tasks**:
- Any status works
- No auto-chain behavior

### Generation Issues

#### "No API Key" error

**Solutions**:
1. Settings > Claude Settings
2. Enter API key from console.anthropic.com
3. Save settings

#### "Request timeout"

**Solutions**:
1. Settings > Claude Settings
2. Increase timeout to 120-180 seconds
3. For very complex enhancements, try 300 seconds

#### "Poor quality output"

**Solutions**:
1. Switch to Claude Opus 4 for complex tasks
2. Provide more detailed description
3. Add relevant reference files
4. Increase max tokens

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I use without Claude API?**  
A: Yes! All features work except AI-powered generation. You'll write descriptions manually.

**Q: Can I create workflows with different numbers of steps?**  
A: Absolutely! CMAT supports workflows of any length (2 steps, 10 steps, whatever you need).

**Q: Where are workflow templates stored?**  
A: In `.claude/queues/workflow_templates.json`

**Q: Can agents be reused across workflows?**  
A: Yes! Agents are assignable to any number of workflows. Same agent, different workflows, different behavior.
